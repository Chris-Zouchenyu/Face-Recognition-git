##  
The algorithm performs poorly in face comparison. This may be because the original siamese neural network can only compare the difference between the pixel values of different pictures. The feature extraction ability of the picture itself is poor. If the feature extraction part is added to the original algorithm, it may improve the recognition accuracy of the algorithm, but in general, opencv + siamese neural network is still a good idea in target detection!
